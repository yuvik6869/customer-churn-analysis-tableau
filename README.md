# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing customer churn patterns to identify at-risk customers and revenue opportunities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes 7,000+ customer records to uncover the key drivers of customer churn and provides actionable insights for retention strategies.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **47% churn rate** among first-year customers (3x higher than long-term customers)
- **Month-to-month contracts** account for 89% of all customer attrition
- **Higher pricing tiers** ($70+) correlate with increased churn rates
- **$2.86M** in at-risk annual revenue identified

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Interactive KPI Cards**: Real-time metrics for total customers, churn rate, and revenue impact
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Explore data by contract type, payment method, tenure, and charges
- **Churn Analysis by Tenure**: Visualizes when customers are most likely to leave
- **Pricing Impact Analysis**: Shows correlation between monthly charges and churn
- **Risk Segmentation**: Categorizes customers into high/medium/low risk groups

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Tableau Public** - Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **SQL** - Data extraction and transformation
- **Excel** - Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Statistical Analysis** - Churn pattern identification

## 📈 Business Impact

The dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Identify high-risk customer segments for targeted retention campaigns
- Understand the relationship between pricing and customer loyalty
- Track churn metrics in real-time
- Make data-driven decisions on contract structuring and pricing strategies

## 💡 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:
1. Implement specialized retention programs for first-year customers
2. Incentivize customers to switch from month-to-month to annual contracts
3. Review and optimize pricing strategy for the $70+ tier
4. Focus retention efforts on the 2,341 high-risk customers identified
